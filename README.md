## About

I am a **Frontend Developer with 3+ years of professional experience**, specializing in building **scalable, maintainable, and production-ready web applications** using React and modern JavaScript technologies.

I have worked across **startups, product companies, and client-driven environments**, contributing to applications that focus on **performance, clean architecture, and real-world usability**.
